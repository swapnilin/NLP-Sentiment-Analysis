# NLP-Sentiment-Analysis

In this notebook I will demonstrate how to pre-process and clean text data for Natural Lanuage Processing applications and how to perform Sentiment Analysis on the data.

**Sentiment analysis** is a subfield of natural language processing (NLP) that involves analyzing and classifying the subjective opinions and attitudes expressed in text data, such as reviews, social media posts, and customer feedback. The goal of sentiment analysis is to determine the polarity of the sentiment, i.e., whether the expressed opinion is positive, negative, or neutral.

Sentiment analysis can be performed using machine learning techniques, such as supervised learning or unsupervised learning, to train models that can classify text into different sentiment categories. These models use a variety of features and techniques, such as bag-of-words, N-grams, and part-of-speech tagging, to identify patterns in the text and predict the sentiment.

Sentiment analysis is useful in a variety of applications, such as customer feedback analysis, social media monitoring, brand reputation management, and market research. It can help businesses and organizations to understand customer opinions and feedback, identify emerging trends, and make informed decisions based on the insights gained from the analysis.
